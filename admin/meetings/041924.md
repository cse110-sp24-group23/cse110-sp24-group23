### Items for Future Discussion
- We don't know whether this Warm-Up is supposed to be a work-log or a scheduler. We decided to go with work-log for now since we have no specifications. 
- Solidify multiple different decisions when we have more specifications
    - We may create groups based on comfort levels, so 1&4 and 2&3 may be a group
## Decisions & Reasonings
- Our Warm-Up is going to be a work-log application
- Benji's words of wisdom is to let everyone dip their feet into all roles because everyone will eventually need to know CSS and HTML
